    "- Age: Numerical | The age of patients in years\n",
    "- Sex: Categorial | Sex of the Patient\n",
    "- ChestPainType: Categorical | Different Chest Pain Types Ex: TA: Typical Angina, ATA; Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic\n",
    "- RestingBP: Numerical | Resting BP Measured in mm HG\n",
    "- Cholesterol: Numerical | Serum Cholesterol\n",
    "- FastingBS: Categorical | If the Blood Sugar > 120mg then 1, Otherwise 0\n",
    "- RestingECG: Categorical | With Normal, ST, LVH as the options\n",
    "- MaxHR: Numerical | Value between 60 and 202\n",
    "- ExerciseAngina: Categorical | Yes or No -> Exercise Induced Angina\n",
    "- Oldpeak: Numerical | Numerical Value For ST\n",
    "- ST_Slope: Categorical | Up, Flat, or Down\n",

We looked through the different sites and information and we concluded that this was an data entry error and a typo of Fatal. Originally this would affect the insights we wanted to create, so we ended up replacing the \"Fetal\" entries with \"Fatal\". "

    "\n",
    "#### Objective Recap:\n",
    "The goal of this report was to analyze two distinct datasets – one related to heart disease prediction and the other to traffic accidents – to extract meaningful insights and provide actionable knowledge. By combining statistical analysis and data visualization, this report aimed to uncover critical patterns and trends that may not be immediately apparent in raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Heart Disease Prediction Dataset:\n",
    "- Elevated cholesterol levels and fasting blood sugar were found to be significant indicators of heart disease.\n",
    "- Older individuals (aged 50+) showed a higher prevalence of heart disease, particularly those with exercise-induced angina or abnormal ST slope patterns.\n",
    "- Gender-based insights revealed that men were more likely to have heart disease compared to women, emphasizing the need for gender-specific prevention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Traffic Accident Dataset:\n",
    "- Most accidents occurred on dry roads, with urban areas showing higher accident frequencies during afternoon hours due to increased vehicle and pedestrian activity.\n",
    "- Accidents on roads with a 30 MPH speed limit were frequent but less severe, while higher-speed roads had fewer but more fatal accidents.\n",
    "- Improved lighting conditions at night were associated with reduced accident severity, highlighting the importance of infrastructure improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implications:\n",
    "These findings are valuable for their respective audiences:\n",
    "    Medical and Public Health Professionals can use the heart disease insights to improve screening and prevention strategies, focusing on high-risk groups and key indicators like cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting blood sugar.\n",
    "    Urban Planners and Policymakers can leverage the traffic accident insights to enhance road safety measures, implement stricter speed limit enforcement, and prioritize lighting improvements in high-risk areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing the unique challenges and opportunities highlighted in each dataset, this report provides a data-driven foundation for actionable decision-making in healthcare and urban safety planning."
